Hello, World!

I am a rising senior at Boston College. I am working towards getting my BS in Management with a concentration in Information Systems and a minor in Philosophy. I am interested in data analytics, female entrepreneurship, and sustainability. I haven't had too much experience with coding before, so let's see how this goes!
